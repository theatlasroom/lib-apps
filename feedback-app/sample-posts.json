I tried to use the scanner on Level 2, but it produced an error message saying I should see an attendant. After waiting in line at the single IT support officer on the ground floor for several minutes, I was told to use either the flatbed scanner or the other MFD on the ground floor. There were queues for both, and I chose the flatbed. However, upon opening the software, it became apparent that one could only save files as images, and not combine them into PDFs. I waited in the other queue for the MFD, only to be met with the message that my account was locked and that I should see an attendant. I queued again for IT support, only to be told that I would have to wait ten to fifteen minutes, and that the scanner and photocopier services were overseen by a different area. Since an hour had elapsed since I entered the library, I gave up my attempt to scan the document.

And one (500 Nations) seems to have been on order \/in process as a DVD since Sept. 2013. I am interested in Episode 6\r\n\r\nI don;t know about streaming, but I do know that our lecture theatres have been equipped to play YouTube without any sound, so not a satisfactory substtute for the videos.\r\n\r\nIt is deeply concerning that we were not consulted about  or even informed about this decision.
