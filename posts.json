I tried to use one today and found, as usual, that they were all taken. Not surprising due to the number of students vs the number of lockers. What has me royally peeved, however, is that i stood waiting- in the end, for an hour. Each time someone would come and remove their computer they would then close it, and lock it- saving it for future use. Several other people came and unlocked lockers that had been empty and placed their computer in them. In the end a locker did become avaliable and the girl removing her things from it only removed a pencil case and a binder. There are not enough powerpoints around the library to service everyone with a laptop. May I suggest having a window at the front where library staff can peep in and if there is no computer, empty the contents where it can be collected from the front desk.  If no improvement is made to the system, i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to end up having to go to the dark side- getting here early to save myself a locker, like all the selfish people doing it now.

This means you can easily get caught out thinking that like any other general LTU book you will have another option to renew them a second or third time.  In reality I often renew my books when I'm away from home, such as when I'm at work or at uni, and the books I'm renewing are not physically with me.  I use the due date online to tick for another renewal, and then discover that the bonus book should have been returned and can't be renewed.  It's frustrating and a fines trap as it is not always possible for me to get to uni that day.  Why not add a banner over the renewals page to remind borrowers that Bonus Books only get one renewal? Or asterisk bonus books on students' borrowing records with this information accompanying every Bonus book borrowed?  Please make this vital difference in borrowing rights more transparent with fine preventative alerts and reminders. The Bonus system at the moment can be revenue raising and punitive, not educational and supportive. Add this issue to the carbon miles involved in transporting books around Australia and from New Zealand and it seems a dicey option that shouldn't be encouraged or made available at all, unless fine revenue is the real goal.

I accidentally forgot to return them and when I checked my fine that night it was $4.50 for each book. That was acceptable. I woke up early the next morning and went straight to the library at 8:30am (the opening time) to return the books and the fine went up to $14.50 each. I thought that the fine didn't include the hours when the library is closed. Then I was told by the librarian that it counts by the hour. AND when I asked THEN I was told I could return the books at the after hour chute. There were no signs in the reverse section (where I borrowed my books) that say I can return the books after hours or where I can return my books after hours. I believe the $29 is unreasonable and it appears to be punishing me for my ignorance.I was never told there is another method to return overdue books, if I knew i would've returned them as soon as I found out not the early next morning when the library opens again. I never had an overdue book ever since I started borrowing from the library (you can check your system).  Please consider that it was my first time having an overdue book and I wasn't informed about the after hour chute.

It is incredibly rare that I feel the need to complain, especially with regards to customer service. I understand people have 'off days' and it is often hard to keep a constant smile on your face for an eight\/ten hour shift. Nonetheless, this complaint is the result of two years of accumulated frustration. \r\nI am a frequent user of this library, I spend an average 25 hours a week studying in the carrels. The new renovations to the library are first-rate and it is generally a very comfortable place to study. \r\nUnfortunately I now live in fear of approaching the majority of the librarians on the front desk and those who are re-shelving books. This trepidation is shared by a number of my peers. We are frequently met by grunts, snatching and sneers just on account of producing a student card to pick up a carrel key. I politely asked a gentleman in Reserve this morning if he could help me locate a book that was marked as \"recently returned\" and it was if I had asked him to pull his own teeth out. (Needless to say the book was not found and I was dismissed with the turn of his back). \r\nI am sick of being sneered and grunted at on a daily basis by those who I am assuming have been hired based on their ability to provide library assistance to those who seek it. \r\nI am not sure how whoever is in charge of responding to these complaints may go about fixing this situation. The purpose of this email is to draw your attention to the matter in the hope that something adequate will be done to address the often poor levels of customer service provided to patrons of this library. \r\n(It would be prudent to add here that there are a few rare gems amongst the library staff who are a delight to speak to and always willing to help.

The primary purpose of a library is to make books and resources available to those who need them - I'm a PhD student about to finish my thesis and am in urgent need of a number of books, which I'm told are unlikely to become available to me until at least Monday.  I understand that maintenance work may need to be done, but surely the priority of the Library is ensuring access to its resources to the University's students.  You could have at least implemented a system whereby we could request the books and staff could get them for us, rather than making all books on the 3rd floor unavailable with no notice.\r\n\r\nThis is totally unacceptable for a library, and very frustrating for students or staff who need access to books.\r\n\r\nJasmine Westendorf<\/p>","Response":"<p>I am very sorry to hear of your inconvenience.

During semester they are always heavily booked but you can usually get one if you book in advance or benefit from someone else's cancellation. Reserving them for postgraduates is a ridiculous idea. I guarantee they won't use them. I was a postgraduate at Monash and we had a whole separate building dedicated to postgraduate study space. Even though getting a desk there was a competitive process, and people signed up for them, only a minority of students actually used them with any regularity -- I was one of them. So please don't waste valuable library space by dedicating its use to people who, although they may have good intentions, won't actually regularly use it. Please leave it as an open booking system for undergrads and postgrads, and, yes, by all means give postgrads the preferential treatment they currently have, of being able to book for double time. But don't let these rooms become under-utilised spaces where postgrads can store all the lengthy tomes on post-structuralist theory they aspire to read.

I am writing with some comments about the Borchardt Library in its current form.\r\n\r\nI like serveral things about the renovations, like some of the colour schemes.  However, there is a tendency to change for the sake of it?  For instance, the TV sets in the audiovisual area were old type Panasonic 34 cm sets, perfectly functional.  The TCL flat screen sets need remote controls to start them.  The image on the new sets is rather inferior.  I ask: would have TCL in your own home?  I think you would not.  This is an example of a change that has not not enhanced much at all.\r\n\r\nI also doubt if all the carrels need to be replaced.  The veneer timber tone of the old ones seemed sturdier that the \"white Tupperware\" plank the separates the new ones.  The new carpet upstairs was needed, but gosh, there was a lot of dust, wasn't there?\r\n\r\nThe last print edition of the Library News is a metaphor for the status of print, it seems.  At least you carry many printed journals still and favourite periodicals.  I still liked the old OCE photocopiers of years ago for their simplicity.  If you ensure that things are easily operated people will come.  Complications and newness for its own sake in libraries are major turn-offs for many of us.  \r\n\r\nI heard some guy say the library has become an internet cafe.

I feel that it is very unfair that access has been removed for coursework students, before the room available for us has been built.

I found this method very conveinient and very fair that another student could take my booked carrell if I was too late.  This year, I was disapointed not only to find that I could no longer book online, but in fact that I am no longer allowed to use a study carrell at all!  I was told that only honours and postgraduate by research are allowed to use such rooms.  Whilst I am a postgraduate by classwork and understand that I do not have a thesis to work on like thesis students and as I did as an honours student last year, I still find it is disapointing that I am effectively 'banned' from using such rooms.  I used the carrells often last year and felt it was the best learning environment for me to be able to complete my work.  Now, I feel as though my work is somewhat inhibited given that I cannot use the rooms.  Last year, I found that there were often spare rooms and were very easily able to be booked.  Was there feedback that the rooms were too often taken up by students not completing thesises and taking them away from those that really needed them?  It would really interest me to hear if this was the case, as I found they were readily avaliable using them frequently previously.  \r\nPerhaps I could suggest that the same rules apply as last year to continue fairness across courses?

The sudden and unexpected changes to the availability of study carrels exhibits a lack of reasoning that is coming to characterise La Trobe University. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to consider that Post Graduate students (who are now the only students with access to the study carrels) tend to be older than undergraduate students, therefor they are more likely to have space in their own homes to undertake quiet uninterrupted study. How many post graduate students live at Menzies, Glenn and Chisholm college? To the best of my knowledge, none (and I did reside at one of these colleges at the beginning of my degree). Additionally, the vast majority of students living in share houses are undergraduate students, therefore it is the undergraduate students who use the space to escape noisy and distracting living situations. Not only that, the system as it worked before did not prevent post graduate students from using the spaces; rather, study carrels were readily available for all students, only during exam periods was it difficult to get a booking on short notice. These changes need to be reversed immediately, word of mouth is a powerful thing and as more of these things keep happening La Trobe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation is only going to worsen. By the way, there are signs in the ladies toilets asking users to keep the area clean by putting paper in the bins provided, however by the end of lunch time, there is so much paper in the bins that they are overflowing and no agile placing of paper will stop the paper falling on the floor.

This change is RIDICULOUS.\r\n\r\n1. There was already a FAIR AND EQUITABLE booking system in place being that it was open to all students to book in advance as the need arose \u00e2\u20ac\u201c HDR students were in no way disadvantaged by such a system, they merely had to be organised and book ahead like everyone else. This change UNNECESSARILY and DISPROPORTIONATELY favours HDR students.\r\n\r\n2. HDR students received even less competition from Undergrad student bookings as UNDERGRADS WERE ALREADY LIMITED to a certain number of bookings for a maximum 3 hours, while HDR students received 8.\r\n\r\n3. HDR students HAVE THEIR OWN FACILITIES and resources including offices, lounges, photocopies, kitchens etc. etc. etc. which undergrads, graduate entry and honours students are not privy to. It is the responsibility of their respective faculties to provide those facilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while the role of the library is to provide facilities to ALL students.\r\n\r\n4. This policy will encourage the booking of group rooms for non-genuine \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c merely so people can have a larger place to study with the freedom of a lockable facility.\r\n\r\n5. Said facilities are sitting UNUSED and the new policy does not allow for efficient use of resources. The carrels do not serve their purpose when they stay available on the off chance an HDR student wants to use them on that day. As others have pointed out, the argument that 37 rooms could be full 12 hours a day by HDR students is statistically absurd.\r\n\r\n6. Someone like me has no adequate space to study \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a FULL TIME, FINAL YEAR, GRADUATE ENTRY LAW STUDENT attempting also to write an HONOURS THESIS and prepare for an INTERNATIONAL MOOTING COMPETITION as a representative of this university \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet the university \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cannot\u00e2\u20ac\u009d provide me more than 1m wide and 40cm deep desk-with-a-stylised-curve-that-is-actually-quite-impractical. What a joke. \r\n\r\n7. Students are pretty excited about being provided access to basic necessities, like chairs and power points. But the library shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be congratulating itself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c these are essential items people EXPECT to find in a library. Nor should the library use the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153achievement of being able to function like a library\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to DEFLECT from its persisting inadequacies by saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but look over there, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve given you power points and chairs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the library should be embarrassed that it lacked the essential characteristics of a library for so very, very long, rendering it inoperable as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153library\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for most students once their battery died, or they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a chair. Instead, the library should be focussed on improvements that benefit ALL students \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without excuses.\r\n\r\n8. I pay the highest undergraduate fees per subject for my degree, and I am in full knowledge that my fees substitute the running of other faculties like arts and education. Yet the faculty can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a law library, a law student lounge, nor a law study area (unlike other universities) and now the University can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide individual law students any decent space to study in. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embarrassing. \r\n\r\n9. I regularly go to study at other university libraries owing to the INADEQUACY of this university to supply its students with APPROPRIATE FACILITIES. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be left behind La Trobe, pick up your game.\r\n<\/p>","Response":"<p>Hello Jessica,<\/p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your feedback.&nbsp; The Library Executive will review the decision to allocate the locked carrels to HDR students later this semester.&nbsp; Your feedback will be considered as part of this review.<\/p>\r\n<p>Best wishes,<\/p>\r\n<p>Kerryn Amery, Associate University Librarian - Information Services<\/p>","PermissionToPost":"1","ResponseDate":"2012-03-12 16:42:58","Campus":"3","Name":"Jessica","Email":"jessconnolly28@gmail.com","Telephone":"","Responded":"1","Notes":"","AllocatedToId":"5","PostedOnline":"1","EmailedResponse":"1","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2012-03-12 00:00:00","ID":"195","Feedback":"<p>Library personnel during (short) long weekend [were] most helpful for a very dumb,aged novice.

Firstly the carrels are currently often empty, which shows that one privileged student per carrel cannot and\/or does not want to use their precious designated carrel for every minute the library is open for business each day of every week. Why allow this daily wastage of good study facilities when other students can make excellent use of the empty rooms? Secondly, after a prolonged and difficult library renovation how can we now have such an outlandish shortage of silent, lockable study rooms available for ALL students to share, for single, limited time useage?  Who was responsible for the renovation plan? Are they being held accountable now for such a massive oversight in the demand for and availability of individual study facilities?  An oversight that is causing severe academic distress to hundreds of students? Thirdly, We all understand that research output is imperative for all universities to gain and maintain the best possible national and international rankings. And we all see how high publication of research output severely affects academic staff tenure at La Trobe uni and elsewhere, as is now sorely visible at Sydney uni.  The question for me is why La Trobe university is bent on punishing it's own future research students by denying undergrads adequate (i.e. not luxurious) private study resources to enable them to successfully complete their undergrad degrees?  This is outrageously disloyal, thoughtless and mean behaviour. Are undergrad students really just bums (dollars?) on seats here at La Trobe? Fourthly as a university that teaches both psychology and education (to an esteemed level) can the library and the university please give some thought and credibility to the proven classifications of personality style and learning style.  Any individual's approach to study will largely be directed by their natural (i.e. inherent) learning style and\/or personality style.  This means that a significant proportion of all undergrad students will require a silent, self-contained study carrel to make the best use of their study time.  Using a carrel should not be about a student's level of study or academic achievement; it should be about the personal\/learning styles of the individual student. Students continually try to adjust themselves to meet academic demands that are not drawing on their personal strengths or personal interests, but this latest carrel restriction is way beyond a reasonable request for many students.  Please demonstrate that you understand human neural diversity and care enough to assist all students to work within a learning environment suited to their individual needs. The new format of the reno'd library largely privileges outgoing students who flourish in a shared working environment, aka the first and second levels of the 'new' library. In short, the design of the new library is dramatically favouring one type of study style\/personality style to the detriment of other, equally worthy students. How are the university's plagiarism requirements being upheld in  the library spaces being given over to shared student endeavours?  Group work is not always consistent with an ability to sign off the plagiarism form! Finally, isn't this carrel restriction really just about the chronic shortage of learning and teaching accommodation at La Trobe university?  Isn't it really just a building issue? It is a pleasure to see the new Research Centres being built on the outskirts of the campus with private industry financial assistance.  Can the university please form a professional team of fund raisers to gather sufficient finance to endow each faculty with enough funds to provide suitable study accommodation in each department for their own post graduate students. If the undergrads feel badly about the new study carrel restrictions, how unwanted and under-valued do the post graduate students feel when their own departments wont or can't house their post grad research needs?  Apologies if I have duplicated others' already listed concerns here.  To conclude, please take all of our  concerns to a decision maker higher than the library CEO. This carrel issue reflects badly on the entire university and the problem should be dealt with at the highest levels.  Student welfare and learning\/academic success is dependent upon this issue being addressed urgently and thoroughly by the highest university management team.<\/p>","Response":"<p>Hello Bev,<\/p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your feedback.

We understand your issues and try to provide varied spaces within the library that include both group study and quieter areas for individual study. We are of course constrained by limited areas available for the various needs of students.<\/p>","PermissionToPost":"0","ResponseDate":"2012-04-11 13:49:42","Campus":"2","Name":null,"Email":null,"Telephone":null,"Responded":"1","Notes":"This was manual feedback that was submitted on paper based forms","AllocatedToId":"23","PostedOnline":"0","EmailedResponse":"0","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2011-03-30 00:00:00","ID":"265","Feedback":"Please update toilets","Response":"<p>Thank you for your comments.

As an undergrad, I always booked a study carrel when I had assignments due or during exam periods. I found it very valuable during these peak periods during the semester to be able to walk into the library and know that I had a designated place to study and that I wouldn't have to waste time walking around trying to find a space to study. I loved being able to book in advance when I wanted to study. While there are more work stations, you can't reserve those! The guaranteed study space was so much better. I have read the majority of posts by people who agree with my disappointment in hearing this decision along with your feedback so don't give me a copy\/paste response about the number of study spaces, how quiet level 3 is or about the security guard patrolling the library.\r\n\r\nThe main reason that I enjoyed using study carrels was because they weren't distracting! Being in an enclosed area for 3 hours without a view of people walking past helped me focus a lot more than those squeaky white workstations on level three. I don't go to the library anymore to study. I study at home despite the fact that it is ridiculously disracting but at least I know that my things are safe and that I have a guaranteed study space. Not everyone else has that luxury though. Change it back to 3 hours for undergrads and 8 hours for postgrads. \r\n\r\nThe new system to book rooms and carrels is rubbish too. Change it back to the old online system.<\/p>","Response":"<p>Hello,<\/p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your feedback. We understand your disappointment with this change back to the original purpose of these private study rooms, especially as you personally found this a valuable option. .It is difficult when a facility that you valued is no longer available. You may be aware that those universities building new libraries are no longer able to justify such spaces in the building costs and some universities who still had them have removed them altogether in the interests of providing more equitable study spaces for the majority. As there would have been a cost involved in their removal we chose instead to use that money to replace as many of the small wooden tables as possible (over 400) and to re-assign the individual carrels as personal office space for higher degree students, as they were originally intended.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>\r\nWe are sorry that it is not possible for the Library, to provide a private, lockable study space for every student who wants one. What we have done is zone the building and ensure that the 2,000 plus students in the building have equitable access to collaborative spaces (levels one and two) and silent study carrels (level three).<\/p>\r\n<p>For the few people who were used to booking the study rooms regularly it is a real loss but for the majority of Library users there is a vast improvement in silent study space. I hope that you will appreciate the Library&rsquo;s responsibility to spread its limited resources fairly and according to need.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your comments on the room booking system. The Library will continue to use the University's booking system to manage room bookings rather than maintaining a separate system but we are happy to pass on specific concerns to those who manage it, in the hope that it can be improved.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Best wishes,<\/p>\r\n<p>Kerryn Amery, Associate University Librarian - Information Services.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","PermissionToPost":"1","ResponseDate":"2012-04-12 16:21:47","Campus":"3","Name":"","Email":"","Telephone":"","Responded":"1","Notes":"","AllocatedToId":"5","PostedOnline":"1","EmailedResponse":"0","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2012-04-13 12:33:41","ID":"404","Feedback":"<p>I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it is a good idea for La Trobe to be copying what other Universities have done.  There is evidence to suggest that serious errors in judgement have been made at other Universities, over a number of years, resulting in serious problems and disadvantage.  La Trobe, however, has enjoyed a reputation for putting the needs of students first, being consultative and responsive to student needs.  \r\nHowever, when students are unable to meet their basic needs and the requirements necessitated by their studies, they do what students have always done: COMPLAIN.  Increasingly within the tertiary sector, it has become apparent, that some students may be attracting (quite incorrectly and unfairly), labels such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153querulous complainant\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for taking the trouble to persist in raising real issues of concern within the tertiary sector.  One can only hope: that this is not occurring at La Trobe.   \r\nLast Friday, there was an interesting panel discussion on: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mental Health in Australia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c How is it rating?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d   When I can no longer cope \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I will use the Medicare system to access Psychological Services.  This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help me either and will cost the public purse.  For the Psychologist, it may fund a new bathroom or two and their next holiday (but these days, they mostly claim those under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Conference Leave\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, anyway).  The Psychologist will take my life history, nod-off as I recount all the setbacks, disappointments and woes - and may report (depending on their clinical persuasion), that I have a Personality Disorder: unable to gain satisfaction in life, blames everyone else for their problems and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take personal responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.To this, they might add: feels a sense of entitlement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is another way of saying that you are demanding and unreasonable in your expectations and feel that you are more deserving than others, and so on.  The Psychologist may or, may not have been educated at La Trobe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and may have been able to access one of those carrels (having the glory of being a post-graduate student).\r\nIn any event, it has been identified that there is a broken record type of answer to feedback provided to the Library services about the study spaces within the Library.  If we are all honest and upfront, however, the bottom line for University academics, staffers and students alike, is that we have a resourcing problem (supply and demand imbalance), on our hands.\r\nWhat is going to be done to meet the resourcing requirements of students?\r\n<\/p>","Response":"<p>Hello,<\/p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your feedback.

My feedback relates to both the use of that Plugin and access to the e-book, as they are related and I am not sure of the cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nProblem 1. Schubert-it PDF Browser Plugin does not actually work. I am supposed to be able to view PDFs in my browser, rather than downloading them - but all PDFs I have attempted to view have come up blank.

Nevertheless, I am returning to the issue because I have come to the third level to study, and once again I have noticed that the majority of carrels are empty. When I first complained, I was told that the decision to allocate the carrels for the sole use of HDR students would be reviewed by the library board in the middle of the year. Well it is getting very close to that time, and I would just like to say that this board meeting will give the library authorities a chance to demonstrate whether they actually do regard student satisfaction and needs as paramount. Kerryn Amery who has been responding to most of the complaints has stated that the decision was made because some of the HDR students did not have private offices in their faculties. While this may be true, the majority of those students are evidently not choosing the carrels to study in, because they are EMPTY. She has also stated that the allocation of carrels to HDR students is in line with their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153original purpose\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. I have to say that this is quite a cop-out. Would you give a child an ice cream, and then take it off them claiming that its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153original purpose\u00e2\u20ac\u009d was to be given to someone else? Also with respect to the responses claiming that the university does not have enough space\/resources for everyone to use the carrels; not everyone wants to use them. Some people prefer silent areas to study, some people prefer areas with noisy buzz, and some people hate the idea of sitting in a small room on their own. Everyone is different, but the fact is, in previous years, if you wanted to study in a carrel, you could. Sometimes it might be too busy to get a booking, but you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind, because most the time if you organised one early it was fine. In peak times they were full, in non-peak times like on weekends, they were empty. Now they are empty nearly all the time, so space and resources which are allegedly minimal are being wasted.

These students in particular have family responsibilities etc. and use their time at university for quiet study.  Therefore these students are particularly concerned about the fact that they are no longer able to book the library carrels.  They are finding it difficult to accept this decision to keep the carrels for RHD us only, given that they report that they are often empty.\r\nI understand that the new postgraduate area is almost ready and so there may not be a need for the RHD students to book carrels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps the library will reconsider the matter and make the carrels available for Undergraduate students again.\r\n2.\tStudents do appreciate that Level 3 is nominally a quiet level, but again they are not finding it so quiet.  They also suggest that it is difficult to find space.\r\n \r\nI realize that item 2 has been raised previously, but I think it should be noted that this is a new committee of students.\r\n \r\nAny advice you can give would be appreciated.\r\n \r\n \r\nKind Regards,\r\n \r\n \r\nLillian\r\n \r\nStudent\/Staff Feedback Committee for Law <\/p>","Response":"<p>Hello Lillian,<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThank you for forwarding the Committee&rsquo;s feedback to me. The Library Executive team appreciates receiving comments and suggestions on our services, resources and facilities. Your committee is a good forum for students to raise concerns and make suggestions. Committee members can also utilise the Library&rsquo;s Feedback service. We use the Feedback database to identify trends, issues and problems. Feedback data contributes to Library planning, review and decision making processes.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere are thirty seven lockable carrels on level three. Two of these carrels are set aside for students with learning\/disability needs. The remaining thirty five carrels have been returned to their original purpose as HDR spaces. All thirty five carrels have borrowed by HDR students for the semester. These HDR students use the carrels as their office space and access the carrels when they need to during any of the hours that the Library is open Monday &ndash; Sunday. Like any office space there will be times when the carrels will be empty. The decision to assign the carrels to HDR students was extensively discussed at the recent Library Committee meeting. Library Committee members supported the decision. The Library Executive team will review the decision at the end of first semester. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWork on the new postgraduate area will begin in the next few weeks. The new space will be ready by the beginning of semester one, 2012.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Library team actively works with University Security staff on strategies to manage the learning spaces within the Melbourne Library. We have a security guard who patrols the floors every twenty minutes. Telephones have been installed on each floor that students can use to contact Security or Library staff about noise or disruptive behaviour. Various members of the Library staff, including myself, routinely walk around the building to check on noise, seating availability and the environment in general. Our observations do not match the feedback that we have received from some students. Level three is usually very quiet and there are free carrels available for students wanting to study. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Library is currently conducting its biennial survey.

Last semester I used carrel 328, which was absolutely uncomfortable because of the noisy electric hand dryer in the lady, room behind of my carrel.\r\nA funny and non-sensible incident happens today when I asked a friend of mine to fix my laptop (his wife was with him as well)(I did not carry the battery and it was directly plugged in power point). At the same time, there was a training session running for the library staffs. Suddenly, a lady called \"Rosanna\" saw us from the narrow window of the carrel and walk to us, then knock the door and started aggressively notice the rules to me. She emphasized that only one person can use the carrel, although I apologized for that, I told her that my friend came here and will quickly leave.  But she was really keen to insist that this level is a silent area there should be no talking at all. I told her \"there is no person (even a single one) in the other carrels around because we are still in midyear holidays\" she replied that the rules are the rules.

I'm a PhD student in Life Sciences, and I wanted to make a (recommendation\/request?) for a journal that LaTrobe doesn't subscribe to, but that I regularly access through document delivery and would love to have full access to.

This means that often doc delivery is not adequate (as it can take over a week to deliver the article). The other issue is that articles often have links to recipes etc, which obviously can't be accessed through the .pdf that is sent out when accessed through document delivery. \r\n\r\nThis journal has been a great resource to me throughout my PhD to date, and I think it is an excellent source of lab-based protocol information.

During this period (late 2011 - early 2012) there were times when all the workstations in the lounge were being used, or perhaps one or two not functioning. Most of the people using them seemed to be international students.\r\n\r\nIn addition, sometimes if one's own uni-provided computer isn't working, or printing, for whatever reason, the problem can be sidestepped by using the lounge computers. This has happened to me a number of times in a four-year period. Using one's own lap top is a distinct disadvantage (a) if it is a Mac, which mine was, and (b) because netiher Macs nor PC's easily access the Uni's printing technology.\r\n\r\nSo I do think you need more.

Rather than being the student friendly tool which allowed the student to explicitly pick what referencing style followed by what resource type followed by what format is no longer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the format and logic of the tool was what I believe lent itself to the selection of the Griffith Uni format.  \r\nWhile, as a student, I will still pick an example based on essentially the same logic, it is not as explicit as what the original tool was and as a result, I am not so sure that the new format is as user friendly (although I do appreciate the amount of work that has gone into this).  \r\nOne other thing that you might review associated with ART is that when you go into ARM and select a referencing style, there is still a red tab which says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLTU Referencing Tool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.

I know what job they are applying for.  I know what they are studying.  I know their name.  I know their phone number.  I know their address.  \r\n\r\nThe inappropriate collection of this information was facilitated by the Library's print system.\r\n\r\nAfter confirming my concerns I deposited the resume in the Visy recycle bin next to the printer. My intent in printing the document was for the purposes of this feedback\/email form.  The motives of other people may not be quite as assiduous.\r\n\r\nGiven that the system appears to have been recently updated, it is possible that this update may not yet be fully implemented.  And once completed, this level of access may no longer be available.  A neat response perhaps, but completely inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe level of incompetence and disregard shown in allowing such a level of access to other students' information is inexcusable irresponsible.  The total disregard for the privacy of students' and staff that use this system is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe Library must immediately take action to prevent students from being able to print each others personal documents on the Library's system.  If this cannot be done immediately, then the system must be taken offline until such time as this entirely avoidable blunder is fixed.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion that this is simply necessary as part of a phased implementation of a new print system if deeply offensive and dismissive of students' right to privacy.\r\n\r\nFix it.  Or take it offline.

I am also researching and writing a book on media interviewing. I do regularly take out books on loan from the Latrobe library using my Caval card because your library (with its history and slightly different acquisition policies) contains some excellent texts.

So much so, I am writing to suggest that the LTU library consider it as the primary tool promoted to students - through installation on university computers and linking from library info pages.\r\n\r\nFirst off Mendeley is FREE, and considering that an endnote student licence is $200 I can only imagine what the institutional rate is. \r\n\r\nThey have an active team of developers and are constantly improving their service and adding new features. \r\n\r\nCheck out this comparison table:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/compare-mendeley\/\r\n\r\nThey are more than a reference manager. Mendeley allows users to link with collaborators via groups and shared refs, pdfs, and annotations. They also have facility to share content with class lists - potentially useful given the university's move towards only delivery.\r\n\r\nMore stuff they do:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/how-we-help\/\r\n\r\nFor university libraries, they have an institutional edition which allows you to track the most read journals by users in your network. Helping to make smarter purchasing decisions. An institutional package also automatically upgrades the accounts of all university users, allowing extra collaborators to be added to more private groups.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/mendeley-institutional-edition\/\r\n\r\nMendeley is a fantastic resource for students as well as  academic research groups. It is infinitely more user friendly than endnote, has more features, and just works like it is supposed to. Dumping endnote as the university's primary reference manager will save you money and improve the user experience of staff and students.\r\n\r\nMendeley are all about open access, they let users share and annotate pdf content (covered under fair use); they allow you to export your entire library at any time and migrate to any other platform; custom reference style creation is easy through the open source and online visual CSL (citation style language) editor; and an amazing API lets anyone write apps to mine anonymous data for trends.\r\n\r\nPlease download a copy for yourselves and test it out. \r\nhttp:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/download-mendeley-desktop\r\n\r\nMigrating your existing endnote library is super easy: http:\/\/support.mendeley.com\/customer\/portal\/articles\/227897-how-do-i-import-my-existing-references-from-endnote-\r\n\r\nI would have loved this as an undergrad, and I would love to use the expanded team features with my lab.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam","Response":"<p>Hello Adam,<\/p>\r\n<p>Thankyou for your feedback on Mendeley.&nbsp; I have forwarded your feedback to to the Library team responsible for bibliographic management and asked them to investigate your suggestion.<\/p>\r\n<p>Best wishes,<\/p>\r\n<p>Kerryn Amery, Associate University Librarian - Information Services<\/p>","PermissionToPost":"0","ResponseDate":"2013-04-23 15:08:36","Campus":"3","Name":"Adam","Email":"aptaranto@students.latrobe.edu.au","Telephone":"","Responded":"1","Notes":"Forwarded to Simon, Ana, Margaret, Linda, Fiona for investigation.","AllocatedToId":"21","PostedOnline":"0","EmailedResponse":"1","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2013-04-23 18:28:26","ID":"768","Feedback":"I'm looking for how to find the place to book a study carrel for just myself, 1 person.

Why does the library only provide information and training on the use of one, proprietary, tool?","Response":"<p>Thank-you for your feedback.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are numerous reference management software packages available and the functionality they offer is constantly changing, so the Library is always open to receiving new feedback about the advantages of one package over another. The University has offered EndNote for many years, since EndNote was assessed as being the best option at the time this decision was first made. The Library has invested time developing support for EndNote and would need to consider issues such as cost if it was to pursue and support other packages.<\/p>\r\n<p>In previous years the library has compared EndNote with other reference management packages, concentrating mainly on RefWorks although other packages were considered. At that time, EndNote was still considered to be the best option. The Library will definitely consider and note your feedback, however at this time we are not planning to review the reference support package this year.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the main reasons why EndNote has been chosen as the best package is that it can support all four of the LTU styles. Other reference management utilities generally support APA, but don&rsquo;t do so well with LTU&rsquo;s version of Harvard, Oxford and AGLC. While it&rsquo;s possible to create custom styles in other packages such as Mendeley, this is a very time-consuming process and the Library doesn&rsquo;t have the resources to support this.<\/p>\r\n<p>While the Library doesn&rsquo;t have the resources to provide training and support for packages such as Mendeley and Zotero on top of EndNote, these free packages can be easily downloaded and installed and students are welcome to use them if they prefer them to EndNote. Supporters of Mendeley and Zotero often state that these packages are far more intuitive to use than EndNote, and if this is true we would expect students could use them with little or no extra support from the Library.<\/p>\r\n<p>Clayton Bolitho, Faculty Librarian - FSTE, Bendigo Campus<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>","PermissionToPost":"1","ResponseDate":"2013-05-14 16:40:27","Campus":"3","Name":"","Email":"","Telephone":"","Responded":"1","Notes":"","AllocatedToId":"21","PostedOnline":"1","EmailedResponse":"0","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2013-04-29 11:24:35","ID":"773","Feedback":"Sorry to complain, but why is Level 3 always so hot?

The Library is in the process of ordering &quot;shelf wobblers&quot;, or signs, to help students and staff understand the extent ofour virtual collections.<\/p>\r\n<p>Do you have something in mind to help students find their way to the print collections they need?<\/p>\r\n<p>Thanks and best wishes<\/p>\r\n<p>Eva<\/p>\r\n<p>Eva Fisch,Collection Development Manager<\/p>\r\n<p>e.fisch@latrobe.edu.au<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>\r\nPlease kindly consider your environment before printing this e-mail<\/p>\r\n<p>Warning to recipients:<br \/>\r\nThis email and any attachments are confidential and subject to copyright.

I went to the IT desk and they told me that basically there wasn't enough internet for all the students. That they weren't expecting this many. I can&Acirc;&acute;t believe this could happen. As far as I know, each new student goes through a whole registration process, I'm pretty sure you have a good idea of how many students you'll have. Besides, we're in the middle of the semester, it's about time this was fixed.\r\n2) Each floor is supposed to have a noise level. This is only respected in the third floor. The second floor has several quiet study areas which are anything but quiet. I don't mind some noise, I understand that if I want complete silence I should go to the third floor. However, if I want to be able to study in a group, I need to be able to talk quietly and I believe this is what the 2nd floor is all about. Some thing should be done about this.\r\n3) There are never enough tables, chairs, etc for the great number of students in the university in the first and second floors. With an increase in students there should be an increase in the capability of installations.\r\n4) I don't understand why you make students leave the library after closing time and then allow us to return. We have to interrupt our studies and our work and waste 15 to 20 minutes outside. This makes no sense to me.\r\nI really hope to hear back from you soon and wish that improvements can be applied.\r\nI appreciate your time.","Response":"<p>Thanks for your feedback on a number of issues. I can respond to the Internet issue. The ICT department have been replacing wi-fi access points in the Library for 6-8 months and are still working on this. There are now over 1000 connections available on level 1, with over 4000 connections available&nbsp;in the whole library building. However, there have been problems with iPads connecting to some of these connection points. ICT&nbsp;are addressing this right now by installing software fixes to the Cisco wireless infrastructure, which will hopefully help with the Internet problem. In terms of ongoing connection issues, I will report this to ICT so that they continue to be aware of the problem and can address issues with saturation of the internet connections in the Library.&nbsp; In terms of the other issues, I will ask my colleagues to reply regarding noise levels and furniture. Regarding you final point (number 4) about having to leave the library, this is definitely an annoying interruption for everyone but&nbsp;is a necessary thing in order to provide a safe and secure study environment late at night.

I can understand your frustration with the Library's wireless connections. ICT&nbsp;have been upgrading the systems and there are now about 50 wireless access points in the Library on all levels, which should cater for about 3000 users at the most.

In&nbsp;terms of access to computers or areas with better wi-fi, level 3 at the northern end of the building (the far end, opposite where you come in) is a good one for connections. The other thing is to try to get a free PC during extended opening hours if you can make it during those times. The Library is committed to having long hours for students to use the Library and connect via PCs or wifi in the Library after hours.

I have received several complaints about a recent decision to allow eating and drinking on the 3rd floor of the library. One PhD student is no longer able to work in the library at all as the stench of food makes her nauseous; I have received another complaint about student's work being ruined by coffee stains, or food stains on the books they pick up.  My daughter completed Year 12 last year and is having a 'gap' year; last week she came to work with me as we were attending an event in the evening, and spent some time reading in the library.  She is not particularly 'academically-minded', and doesn't know what she wants to do next year. Nevertheless, she commented that the library is 'ridiculous' - even with earphones she was unable to read a book due to the noise level, and she informed me that such a library would convince her to look at other universities, even though she likes the La Trobe campus and the courses it offers.  Another student told me they had found themselves having to climb over groups of students having a picnic on the 3rd floor, complete with thermoses and hot curries. Personally, as a PhD student I no longer work in the library at all. The books I need are no longer there,it isn't possible to browse the shelves for related books or journals, and with only 9 computers dedicated to postgraduate students and constant noise it is no longer feasible or productive.  This makes a mockery of the Vice-Chancellor's claims that the univeristy wants to attract world-class postgraduate students.  The decision to allow eating and drinking in the library at all is offensive, but to allow it on the one floor that is supposed to be dedicated to study is incomprehensible; a library is not a student common room, and whilst management clearly believe students are not interested in having a place where they can actually work, I can assure you that this is not the case: students have work that they must do, and desperately need a proper space where they can do it.  Furthermore, not a single student had complained to the SLAs that they were not able to eat and drink on the 3rd floor, making the decision to allow it even more incomprehensible.

Upon the entrance into the library at about 5:10pm, I could not find a single spot to sit and plug in my lap-top computer because people left their personal belongings on the tables and chairs before they cleared the library at 5pm. And I am not talking about one or two or three tables, but absolutely at every table, every spot was made seemingly reserved by people who deliberately left their items there. After circling the library a few times in search of a spot, I tried to talk to the person at the front about that, but he just said: &quot;I know,&quot; and then just appeared uninterested in talking or responding in any way. So, I left. This is very frustrating and disappointing because I have been a student at Latrobe University for a long time now and I do not mean to grudge over this because my overwhelming experience at the library has been a good one, but this needs to be addressed. Regrettably, this incident has cost me a lot of fuel, money, energy and time, which is highly disappointing.  And it is absolutely fantastic that the library has been open for the extended hours over the course of this semester, but the rules of removing one's belongings when clearing the library at 5pm must be enforced to ensure fairness to everybody, especially on days when high attendance can be anticipated. I was thinking about taking one of the spots anyway, but at the same time I did not want to end up entering into any sort of altercation with anyone in case they protested. I was just too frustrated, and I decided that it is best to go and talk to the staff, but what do you do when the staff ignores you? I've used the extended hours this semester on a few occasions (including the last two nights) and it has never been this busy, but obviously it can happen, and therefore I hope that this will be taken into consideration and addressed in the future.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this.

This student could have asked the security guard or a library staff member to deal with the noise problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>The building is equipped with Wifi making it easy for students to connect their tablets, phones and laptops to the network.

We also recognise that students, particularly international students use the library's IT to communicate with family and friends, and sometimes for entertainment. The Library team are wary of making judgements about appropriate use of IT. For example, two students were looking at a 'video' game on one of the computers outside my office last night. I spoke to them because they were sharing a headset and the sound of the game was disrupting other students. On first impression you might think that they were simply wasting time but they are studying gaming technology. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and other social media are used for 'study purposes'. I use them for work and for pleasure. Watching films, using shopping sites, playing games, etc could be study related and are sometimes linked to from the LMS. Learning happens in all sorts of ways. Sometimes students take a break from writing an essay to surf ebay for 10 minutes - the equivalent of a tea break. I think that's fine.

I apologize for my late reply.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I had already been informed about the exclusive use of the\r\nsecond floor's Postgraduate study area at the library's front desk.

However, the problem is when you need to study or work in groups;\r\nsometimes there just isn't enough space for all the students, or when you\r\nneed to use a computer, there aren't enough. Besides, during after-hours the second and third floors are closed, which makes it more complicated to find a place to study during mid-terms and finals specially.

I've also informed people that their conversations are offensive and that it would be a good idea if they stopped, to which responses have ranged from people laughing in my face and continuing their conversations to people talking even louder in spite. It's absolutely disgusting.\r\n \r\nI haven't felt comfortable using the library in over a fortnight as it has become a very counter-productive environment.\r\n \r\nUnfortunately (unfortunate because I feel as if university students should be able to take more responsibility and house more maturity) I feel that these issues need to be tackled, with great expense to everyones time, and university funds. \r\n \r\nFirstly, there needs to be mass emails sent out to every student informing them that this behaviour will not be tolerated. Secondly, there needs to be more staffing in the library, and people must be asked to leave if they are having such offensive and loud conversations. \r\n \r\nI know that the second option may not be finically viable, but something has to be done in order to combat these issues. \r\n\r\nI find it disgraceful that as student (who pays fees) at La Trobe, I don't even feel comfortable in my own Library.\r\n\r\nI've had to search the university for another place where myself and peers can sit down and quietly study.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease keep me informed of all proceedings regarding this complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Leighton\r\n<\/p>","Response":"<p>Hello Sarah,<\/p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your feedback.

On the second floor by having large tables for 5-10 people to use and then asking that it be a 'quiet' floor seems very unreaslistic - how do 5-10 people discussing work actually keep quite? It's just as noise as the first floor and the idea that that there is 'three' different noise levels for floors I think is a bit of a fiction. At the moment there's 1&amp;2 = talk and 3 = silent. \r\n\r\nPersonally I think only the first floor should be made for group work with the second and third being complete silent floors since the majority of people I see doing actual 'work' are on their own and the people on the tabels simply socialise... why did the library go towards a 'group' target anyway?

(Request 11111642431.) Unfortunately the scan I was sent was incomplete. Pages 736 and 737 were missing. Probably it was done in a hurry. It would certainly be useful if I could have these pages as well.\r\n\r\nI hope you will forgive me if I express some frustration with the current library arrangements. However, it seems to me that this sort of problem would not have happened if it had not been for the puzzling decision to remove nearly all journals from the library. During the many decades I was on the library liaison committee, the main problem we had to deal with was government cutbacks. I was certainly surprised when the library had an unexpected one-off increase in funding and someone decided to spend this money on transforming the library into something more like a club than a library, with a large food outlet, and lots of empty floor space, but hardly any books and even fewer journals. However, I was already emeritus when this happened and so had no say in the decision.\r\n\r\nEven more surprising has been the choice of the tiny proportion of journals still kept in the library. The usual justification given for keeping journals inaccessible has been that they are available on the internet. \r\n\r\nThey may be available on the internet, but they are not available to us, as the library\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subscription allows very limited access.  \r\n\r\nOur subscription for the journal I wanted goes back only to 1997. For some reason, the few journals still available in the library are the most recent issues, which are often precisely those which are available on the internet. The fact that we subscribed to this journal from the start, which was before the university opened, and that it was very highly ranked in the recent ERA exercise (and was also expensive) should have suggested that it was worth having the entire journal available either in the library or through our online subscription. \r\n\r\nWhy is it that the few journals still available in the library are usually precisely those available on the internet with the library\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current subscription? Surely it would be better to ensure that the journals that we have already paid for (often paying a very high subscription), but which are not available with our online subscription, are kept in the library. One of the many problems with replacing hard copies with internet subscription is that availability on the internet can often change with little warning. In particular, our Springer subscription now seems of poorer quality than it was a few years ago. Our old subscription allowed us to see citations of individual articles. This facility does not seem available with the new Springer web site.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we can retrieve articles from the annexe is certainly much better than nothing, but it is no substitute for having the journals readily available. The fact that pages may be missing from the scanned copies, as happened in this case, is only one of the disadvantages. The scanned copies are often hard to read, especially near the margin beside the binding (though the paper you sent me was OK in this respect). Also there is always the delay. Also, scanned copies are never of the same quality as the PDFs generally available from the publisher if we have a subscription.\r\n\r\nI have often heard it said that only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low use\u00e2\u20ac\u009d material has been removed. I am not sure how this is measured. I have been a heavy user of the La Trobe University library since 1967, but I cannot recall ever having borrowed a journal, and I have only occasionally borrowed  a book, as I have done most of my reading in the library. If usage is measured by counting borrowings, the material I have used may all be considered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low usage\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. My use of the library was reduced dramatically after the recent changes, not because I stopped wanting to use the journals, but because they were rarely there when I wanted them. In most cases I have just given up when something was unavailable. This has certainly not helped my research. And, like many who retired while still active, I am still trying to continue with my research (and have published 10 papers since I  retired, as well as doing a lot of refereeing).\r\n\r\nApologies for the gripe. But it would be nice if the journals we have already paid for were easier to retrieve.\r\n\r\nAlan Andrew (extn 1208, emeritus scholar in mathematics and one of the old timers)\r\n<\/p>","Response":"","PermissionToPost":"0","ResponseDate":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Campus":"3","Name":"Alan Andrew","Email":"a.andrew@latrobe.edu.au","Telephone":"1208","Responded":"0","Notes":null,"AllocatedToId":"5","PostedOnline":"0","EmailedResponse":"0","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2013-11-14 00:00:00","ID":"939","Feedback":"<p>The boiling hot water tap on level one of the Bundoora Library often runs out of hot water.

Initially it surprised me that you close the library so early during the semester, but the fact that this remains unchanged during the exam period is unbelievable. I wonder if you have ever seen the amount of students that have to cramp themselves in the first floor during after-hours. It strikes me as though this school cuts costs with no regard to students, no matter how illogical this might be or how much it might affect us. As if this wasn't enough, you announce that you're closing 6 times in half an hour, and today in particular someone went by the third floor telling everyone to leave 10 minutes before. I told this person that with all due respect I had heard the previous announcements and that I would leave on time and her answer included the phrase &quot;whatever, we all want to go home, have a good Sunday&quot;. I'm sure you must have heard complaints about this general subject before and nothing has happened but hopefully someone someday will care enough to do something about it. I'm sure you will have a perfect justification for this complaint that will make my comments seem unfounded from your point of view but I would ask you to try and see this from a student's point of view, considering the major workload and high stress levels we face during each semester end. Maybe this will encourage you to at least ask your employees to avoid this kind of responses... hopefully something will change.

The staff are always friendly and I love the layout of the library where you can find a nook to do individual study or have group study\/meetings around a table. The only complaint I have is that at times it is hard to study as people seem to congregate in the lounge area to socialise which then causes a lot of noise and at times I and other students have had to go and find another area on the campus to study. Generally this is not a problem however when stressed as we have assignments or exams that we must pass this can cause a bit of frustration and further stress. I love that people get together and chat so could it be that the lounge area needs to move to the other side of the library as there seems to be a lot of spare space there and it would not interrupt those that are trying to study.(student)<\/p>","Response":"","PermissionToPost":"0","ResponseDate":"2014-03-20 17:49:29","Campus":"5","Name":"","Email":"","Telephone":"","Responded":"1","Notes":"received via Kerryn LRC Mildura survey Dec 2013","AllocatedToId":"23","PostedOnline":"0","EmailedResponse":"0","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2013-12-06 17:36:13","ID":"956","Feedback":"so i could not get an article to open- the link is here- \r\nhttp:\/\/0-sw.oxfordjournals.org.alpha2.latrobe.edu.au\/content\/28\/1\/12.full.pdf+html\r\n\r\ni spoke with a librarian, (at 5.15pm , on the 6\/12\/13) who after 10 minutes of searching could not even find the fucking article using the search function on the library site.. this was incredibly frustrating, so i hung up on her.. she was very nice and friendly but was unable to help. can you please train your staff to at least know how to perform simple searches using the library search engine..\r\n\r\n","Response":"<p>Responded to the student by email.<\/p>","PermissionToPost":"1","ResponseDate":"2013-12-20 14:28:52","Campus":"3","Name":"Lee Lendvay","Email":"lrlendvay@students.latrobe.edu.au","Telephone":"0405304262","Responded":"1","Notes":"","AllocatedToId":"5","PostedOnline":"0","EmailedResponse":"1","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2013-12-11 11:48:40","ID":"957","Feedback":"Is there any sort of process in place for missing books?

Will we have an explanation of why times are changed if they are in fact changed?\r\n\r\nI understand you have said that the library is open for 17 hours of the day, however, many people work all day. You then need a break after 5pm before starting your studies, so let's say you get started at 7-8. That leaves 4-5 hours to study, which understandably sounds like a lot, but in reality, it is not.\r\n\r\nMy main question is why is the review being undertaken and what is it involving? Does it involve feedback from students or is it going to be a purely financial decision?","Response":"<p>Hello,<\/p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your feedback. In 2013, the Library commenced an internal service delivery review and a review of opening hours was part of this service delivery review. The review was conducted within the context of Future Ready, the University&rsquo;s strategic vision and goals. The review included:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&bull; consideration of current services. Were they relevant, still needed? How could they be improved? What services were no longer needed? <br \/>\r\n&bull; identification of new services that would contribute to the University&rsquo;s Learning and Teaching, and Research plans<br \/>\r\n&bull; consideration of staffing resources required to deliver ongoing and new services<br \/>\r\n&bull; trials of extended opening hours at Mildura - opening on Sunday afternoons and at Bendigo - opening until midnight Monday &ndash; Thursday during semester. <br \/>\r\n&bull; analysis of student feedback and survey data to identify issues, themes and trends pertaining to customer service.<br \/>\r\n&bull; analysis of statistics by hour, day, week and month &ndash; usage of services, number of queries, usage of library buildings and facililties<\/p>\r\n<p>As a result of this analysis, new opening hours were proposed to ensure that we have opening hours which are consistent with demonstrated student demand. The Library has consulted a range of stakeholders across the campuses regarding the opening hours. These consultations have included the student unions at Wodonga, Bendigo and Melbourne. This week the&nbsp;University Librarian is meeting with representatives from the Melbourne Student Union to discuss their feedback and suggestions.<\/p>\r\n<p>I encourage you to submit any comments that you would like considered as part of the review via the Feedback link on the Library website or by email to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Best wishes,<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Kerryn Amery, Associate University Librarian - Information Services<\/p>","PermissionToPost":"1","ResponseDate":"2014-03-05 10:45:31","Campus":"3","Name":"Jon","Email":"","Telephone":"","Responded":"1","Notes":"","AllocatedToId":"5","PostedOnline":"1","EmailedResponse":"0","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2014-03-07 10:06:28","ID":"979","Feedback":"Does the library have a legal responsibility to make the collection of books (a university asset) secure?

Can anything be done about this?","Response":"<p>Hello,<\/p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your feedback.&nbsp; Yes, the Library has a responsibility to keep assets such as books secure. Any unborrowed book will set off an alarm if the book is taken from the building.. When the service desk is staffed, Library staff are expected to respond to the alarm and check that books have been borrowed. When the service desk is not staffed, security staff on duty are trained by library staff to fulfil this function. At Melbourne, two guards are on duty after hours and are able to watch the exit doors and respond to any alarms. Our aim is to purchase electronic books where possible; this not only increases access to the books for students, but also removes the issue of books going missing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Best wishes,<\/p>\r\n<p>Kerryn Amery, Associate University Librarian - Information Services<\/p>","PermissionToPost":"1","ResponseDate":"2014-03-11 10:04:33","Campus":"3","Name":"","Email":"","Telephone":"","Responded":"1","Notes":"","AllocatedToId":"5","PostedOnline":"1","EmailedResponse":"0","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2014-03-08 10:03:42","ID":"980","Feedback":"Hi,,\r\nI am writing in regards to the new opening hours of the library. I would recommend to stay with the 24 hour opening time, especially during assignments submission and exams preparation periods. Firstly, as a worldly ranked university, La Trobe Uni should have an accessible library as the basic facility that students can make use of at anytime. Moreover, as this university highly values the diversity and multiculture on campus, students' needs of using the library should be carefully considered, including those are not in the majority. There are students who don't have a study space in their accomodatin, who want to come to the library after work, etc. In addition, the tuition fees increase by 7% annually and because of this, we expect the university to maintain its current services as at the time we enrolled.\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nBest regards.","Response":"<p>Hello,<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThank you for your feedback.
