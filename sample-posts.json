Will we have an explanation of why times are changed if they are in fact changed?\r\n\r\nI understand you have said that the library is open for 17 hours of the day, however, many people work all day. You then need a break after 5pm before starting your studies, so let's say you get started at 7-8.

In 2013, the Library commenced an internal service delivery review and a review of opening hours was part of this service delivery review. The review was conducted within the context of Future Ready, the University&rsquo;s strategic vision and goals. The review included:<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&bull; consideration of current services. Were they relevant, still needed? How could they be improved? What services were no longer needed? <br \/>\r\n&bull; identification of new services that would contribute to the University&rsquo;s Learning and Teaching, and Research plans<br \/>\r\n&bull; consideration of staffing resources required to deliver ongoing and new services<br \/>\r\n&bull; trials of extended opening hours at Mildura - opening on Sunday afternoons and at Bendigo - opening until midnight Monday &ndash; Thursday during semester. <br \/>\r\n&bull; analysis of student feedback and survey data to identify issues, themes and trends pertaining to customer service.<br \/>\r\n&bull; analysis of statistics by hour, day, week and month &ndash; usage of services, number of queries, usage of library buildings and facililties<\/p>\r\n<p>As a result of this analysis, new opening hours were proposed to ensure that we have opening hours which are consistent with demonstrated student demand. The Library has consulted a range of stakeholders across the campuses regarding the opening hours. These consultations have included the student unions at Wodonga, Bendigo and Melbourne. This week the&nbsp;University Librarian is meeting with representatives from the Melbourne Student Union to discuss their feedback and suggestions.<\/p>\r\n<p>I encourage you to submit any comments that you would like considered as part of the review via the Feedback link on the Library website or by email to me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Best wishes,<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Kerryn Amery, Associate University Librarian - Information Services<\/p>","PermissionToPost":"1","ResponseDate":"2014-03-05 10:45:31","Campus":"3","Name":"Jon","Email":"","Telephone":"","Responded":"1","Notes":"","AllocatedToId":"5","PostedOnline":"1","EmailedResponse":"0","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2014-03-07 10:06:28","ID":"979","Feedback":"Does the library have a legal responsibility to make the collection of books (a university asset) secure?

Any unborrowed book will set off an alarm if the book is taken from the building.. When the service desk is staffed, Library staff are expected to respond to the alarm and check that books have been borrowed. When the service desk is not staffed, security staff on duty are trained by library staff to fulfil this function. At Melbourne, two guards are on duty after hours and are able to watch the exit doors and respond to any alarms. Our aim is to purchase electronic books where possible; this not only increases access to the books for students, but also removes the issue of books going missing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Best wishes,<\/p>\r\n<p>Kerryn Amery, Associate University Librarian - Information Services<\/p>","PermissionToPost":"1","ResponseDate":"2014-03-11 10:04:33","Campus":"3","Name":"","Email":"","Telephone":"","Responded":"1","Notes":"","AllocatedToId":"5","PostedOnline":"1","EmailedResponse":"0","UserIP":null},{"Date":"2014-03-08 10:03:42","ID":"980","Feedback":"Hi,,\r\nI am writing in regards to the new opening hours of the library.

There are students who don't have a study space in their accomodatin, who want to come to the library after work, etc. In addition, the tuition fees increase by 7% annually and because of this, we expect the university to maintain its current services as at the time we enrolled.\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nBest regards.","Response":"<p>Hello,<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThank you for your feedback.

I have not yet been able to organise internet at my new residence.\r\n\r\nAt O Week we were advised that there were a number of things that we needed to do before class started in the first week, including a Quiz which was part of our assessment, and that all information will be on the LMS.\r\n\r\nOn the weekend I came to Latrobe Uni Bendigo, I was unable to access the library, printing facilities or power for my computer.  The public library was only open till 1 on Saturday.\r\n\r\nI had some difficulties accessing the Wifi outside of the building and the sunny weather made it difficult for me to view my computer screen.

It is a complaint about our VHS withdrawals .\r\n\r\nI spoke to Diane Kirkby yesterday morning and explained \r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tYes materials were withdrawn as the Library is converting recently used materials to DVD or streaming formats (VHS is a superseded format and equipment is no longer able to be obtained or serviced), \r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tThat the majority of her materials fell into that category and have been replaced by DVD  (noting how she can find them), \r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tHow she can take this opportunity to use streamed video and clips and playlists in lectures to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153add sound and action\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in online teaching \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she seemed keen and asked for training and I directed her to our new video streaming help on the Library web and to her LRS team.\r\n\r\nThe three items she mentions have been actioned , with one already on the shelves in DVD format.\r\n\r\nI am working on some video clipping  exemplars in my Moodle sandpit \r\n-to understand the barriers academics are having in that environment \r\n-these can also be used to show academics how to enhance online teaching.\r\n\r\nFiona\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team will be able to incorporate these examples into online \/ on demand training.\r\n\r\n\r\nEva\r\n\r\nEva Fisch\r\nCollection Development Manager\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Diane Kirkby \r\nSent: Tuesday, 4 March 2014 9:58 PM\r\nTo: Eva Fisch\r\nSubject: RE: teaching material withdrawn\r\n\r\nHi Eva,\r\nI won't be in tomorrow as it's my research day but I'll be at home, on 9890 8717, if  you could call me.\r\n\r\nThe videos that have been removed (that I have been using regularly for many years) seem not to be easily available.\r\nThey are documentaries:\r\n1.The Marriage of Pocahontas  (1995)\r\n2.Jefferson's Blood (PBS, 2000 ) - I don't believe this has been released as a DVD\r\n\r\nOthers on my list as VHS format seem to have been replaced by DVD's which I find much less useful for lecturing so I regret this change but at least I can still (try to) show them.\r\n\r\n3. And one (500 Nations) seems to have been on order \/in process as a DVD since Sept. 2013. I am interested in Episode 6\r\n\r\nI don;t know about streaming, but I do know that our lecture theatres have been equipped to play YouTube without any sound, so not a satisfactory substtute for the videos.\r\n\r\nIt is deeply concerning that we were not consulted about  or even informed about this decision.
